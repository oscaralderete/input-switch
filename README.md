# input-switch

Past month, I assisted to a CSS code camp for developers! After that, I'm ashamed to say it, but I thinked CSS as a toy language, something just for designers.

Before that lecture I have to admit how confused and ignorant I was on CSS. Finally I understand what '::after' and '::before' are! (between other advanced CSS concepts).

Now, I'm not an expert, not a CSS guy, but I have the enough understanding of CSS. That's why I took [this old project](https://github.com/oscaralderete/fancy-radio-checkbox) (it was a clumsy copy-and-paste + trying-and-error project) and refactored it for what you get here.

Visually it's still ugly, but plenty of 'calc()', ':root', 'var()' and other declarations that a developer can understand and respect. There is a LESS file too (no need to be an expert to translate it to SASS in case that's your preferred CSS pre-processor) so you can customize the code easily and quickly. Just try it!
